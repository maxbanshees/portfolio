<p>When using ChatGPT, the response from the AI uses a typewriter animation. I used <a href="https://codepen.io/hi-im-si/pen/ALgzqo">Simon Shahriveri's JS typewriter code</a> to imitate this.</p>
<p><b>Section of article with chat integrated:</b></p>
<p>Let’s start off with some encyclopedic knowledge and the prompt <i>What do you know about origami?</i> The response seems typical of ChatGPT in that it is mostly right and written quite convincingly. All sentences are grammatically correct and make some sense, and could pass for being written by a human even if the style is somewhat dull. However, some other properties of ChatGPT’s writing pop up, which other testers have reported as well.</p>

    <a class="typewrite" data-period="2000" data-type='[ "1. Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding.", "2. It involves using a single sheet of square paper to create a variety of decorative and functional objects, such as animals, flowers, and containers.", "3. Origami originated in Japan in the 17th century, and it has since spread to other parts of the world, where it is enjoyed as a popular hobby and form of artistic expression.", "(There is more text, but I have cut it out for this mockup.)"]'>

<p>First of all, it provides with great confidence information which is not certain or even plain wrong. The “origami originated in Japan in the 17th century” bit is an oversimplification to say the least but consistent what Google’s top answer shows for the query <i>when did origami originate?</i> The answer originates from some random site on the web, and certainly not a reliable origami-specific or even general source. In reality, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_origami">it’s complicated</a> but origami is older than that. By the way, I haven’t fact-checked the Wikipedia article sentence by sentence, so it’s certainly more reliable, but I can’t confirm it’s 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Secondly, the response contains a lot of fluff which does not really mean much. Statements such as the whole third paragraph <i>(There are many different styles and techniques used in origami…)</i> are generic and could be applied to any art or craft. On the other hand, in student essays, such filler is probably often accepted or even encouraged, so as far as cheating on essays goes, this piece would probably pass quite OK.</p>

<p>I continued the conversation to see how the bot would react to me pointing out an inconsistency in its description (it defines origami as always folded from a single sheet, so I ask <i>But there is modular origami which uses multiple sheets</i>). It quickly changes its stance and talks about modular origami. Again, it says much more than it was asked for and apart from the definition provides me with this rather arbitrary statement: <i>Modular origami can be more challenging than traditional origami…</i></p>

<p>
    <a class="typewrite" data-period="2000" data-type='[ "1. Yes, that is correct.", "2. In addition to traditional origami, which uses a single sheet of paper, there is also a type of origami known as modular origami or unit origami.", "3. This type of origami involves using multiple sheets of paper to creat a more complex and large structure.", "(There is more text, but I have cut it out for this mockup.)"]'>

<p>I tried to drill down since some people reported that one can get much improved answers by asking follow-up questions (and in some cases I have as well). To my enquiry <i>But origami is folding a single sheet of paper, so how can modular origami be made of multiple sheets and still be origami?</i> I got a reply which mostly reiterated what was said previously, and in a way did address my concern. However, it felt a bit like manipulative bait and switch along the lines of: yes, I said origami is from a single sheet since I actually meant traditional origami, but in general it doesn’t have to be. When I see ChatGPT make things up on the fly, deliver them very convincingly despite internal inconsistencies, and then swerve whenever it is challenged, certain politicians come to my mind. Some are already very good at this, but tools which can make them even more effective sound potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>One more thing to notice is that the system does not seem to quite find the right tone in its answers. You ask for a definition and get some unfounded opinions in the package. Or the answer to a rather casual question sounds very formal. This certainly makes the response sound less human than it could be. I’m not sure whether this is behavior introduced on purpose or just a side effect of how the system works. Many answers also seem to roughly follow a template and be structured like mini-essays even if this form is a bit ridiculous for such a short response. <a href="https://www.google.pl/search?q=bart+simpson+maize">Bart Simpson’s essay on maize comes to mind.</a></p>

<div class="header2">Afterword</div>
<p>I appreciate the way that Michał is curious, critial, and a little bit humorous about ChatGPT. A follow-up article by the same author [<a href="https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2023-01-12-origami-ai-roadmap">Origami AI — a roadmap</a>] has more thoughts I valued hearing as an illustrator. Notably, he talks about how AI may not fully automate origami visualizing and making as:
<ol>
    <li>Origami is not a common subject in the data sets used to train AI.</li>
    <li>Automating all of the different parts of origami [ex.: ideation, pre-visualization, and physical folding] would be complicated.</li>
    <li>There is not much financial incentive to automate the ideation and assembling of origami models.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast, he mentions that there is more of a financial incentive to automate the work of graphic designers and illustrators with AI. I agree with him on this, but I also want to draw attention to the first two points I mentioned, and riff off of the third.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Some forms of art and design may not have good data sets either.</li>
    <li>Illustration, design, and fine art can be technically, intellectually, and aesthetically demanding. The same goes for the audiences that enjoy these works. For large projects, especially narratively driven ones, I believe a lot of human oversight and care will always be needed.</li>
    <li>There are subject matters, visual styles, and mediums that large companies may not have the financial incentive to automate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't mean to bring these points up to undermine anything Michał has said. In fact, his two article helped me consider how my field would be affected by AI with much more clarity.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with the closing text of his <a href="https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2023-01-12-origami-ai-roadmap">Roadmap</a> article:</p>
