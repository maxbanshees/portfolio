<p>An illustration based off of the following dialogue from the videogame series Pathologic:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Farkhad was a guild fellow of mine… His ardour was disproportionate to his talent.</p>
    
    <p>Yes, he deserved to die. But I didn’t kill him. They say he fell down from a great height and broke his neck. I’ve also heard a rumor that he got lethally intoxicated with bad twyrine…"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as the aesthetic basis for the project <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/farhad">"Death of Farhad"</a>.</p>
